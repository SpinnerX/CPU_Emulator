Description

In this project I am implementing an emulator for the 6502 CPU. As a way to demonstrate Computer Architecture usage. Including in understanding of architectures, as well
utilizing how CPU's work. Involving various concepts such as assembly registers familarity, data sheets, including utilizing hexadecimals to compute how the CPU would respond to certain
instructions.


CPU (struct)
Using this struct handles the registers

Memory (struct)
Handles how memory is working within the CPU.

Step 1
1.) Emulate how a CPU and Memory are both being reset and initialized.
2.) Emulate how the Execute() is going to execute instructions.
